# ðŸ“± Social Media Workflow Complete Guide

## Overview
The Social Post workflow creates engaging social media content for announcements in three streamlined steps. Generates platform-optimized content for LinkedIn and Twitter/X with professional tone and strategic hashtag usage.

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Information Collection
**Goal:** Gather essential information for social media content
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes with intelligent auto-filling

#### Required Information:
- **Company name and description** - Your brand identity
- **Core announcement or message** - What you're announcing (1-2 sentences)
- **Target platforms** - LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram

#### Auto-Filled Defaults (smart defaults when not specified):
- Brand voice and tone: "professional and engaging"
- Target audience: "industry professionals and business community"
- Call to action: "learn more" or "visit our website"
- Hashtag style: Generated from industry/announcement
- Link inclusion: "company website link to be added"
- Visual assets: "visual assets to be determined"

#### Context Awareness Features:
- Extracts ALL relevant information from user messages
- Uses conversation history for company details
- Leverages previous workflow information automatically
- Auto-fills with reasonable defaults rather than asking questions
- Tracks completion percentage including auto-filled fields

#### Completion Criteria:
- Proceeds when 60%+ of fields are filled
- Essential minimum: Company name + core announcement + target platforms
- Responds to "generate" commands immediately
- Only asks about truly required missing information

### Step 2: Asset Generation

### Step 3: Asset Review
**Goal:** Review and refine social media content
**Duration:** As needed for revisions

#### Review Options:
- **Approve:** "approved", "looks good", "perfect", "yes", "ok", "good", "great", "fine"
- **Revise:** Request specific changes to tone, length, hashtags, or platform focus
- **Cross-workflow:** Request different content types (press releases, blog articles, media pitches)

#### Common Revision Requests:
- "Make the LinkedIn post shorter"
