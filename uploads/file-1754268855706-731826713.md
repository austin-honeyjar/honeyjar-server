# üìù Blog Article Workflow Complete Guide

## Overview
The Blog Article workflow creates long-form thought leadership content, news articles, and narrative pieces in three streamlined steps. Perfect for industry insights, company announcements, and thought leadership pieces.

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Information Collection
**Goal:** Gather essential information for compelling blog content
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes with smart auto-filling

#### Required Information:
- **Blog topic or announcement focus** - What you want to write about
- **Key message or central argument** - Your main point or thesis

#### Auto-Filled Defaults (when not specified):
- Target audience: "industry professionals and decision makers"
- Article type: "thought leadership" or "announcement" (based on topic)
- Tone: "professional and engaging"
- Reader action: "learn more about the topic/company"

#### Completion Rules:
- Workflow proceeds when you have a clear topic
- Say "generate this", "proceed", or "skip this" to move forward immediately
- Only asks clarification if topic is completely unclear

#### Smart Context Features:
- Uses conversation history to auto-fill company details
- Extracts relevant information from previous workflows
- Minimizes questions by leveraging available context

### Step 2: Asset Generation
**Goal:** Create high-quality blog article based on collected information
**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

#### Content Structure Generated:
1. **Headline** (50-60 characters, SEO-friendly)
2. **Introduction** (2-3 paragraphs with compelling hook)
3. **Body Content** (narrative-driven with subheadings)
4. **Quote Integration** (from relevant executives/stakeholders)
5. **Visual Elements** (suggested photos/graphics)
6. **Call to Action** (natural, not forced)
7. **Conclusion** (reinforces value and human story)

#### Writing Guidelines Applied:
- **Narrative-driven content** over credential lists
- **Story-focused approach** with emotional connection
- **Conversational, authentic tone**
- **Specific, concrete language** avoiding vague claims
- **600-800 words total length**
- **SEO-conscious** with natural keyword integration

### Step 3: Asset Review
**Goal:** Review and refine generated content
**Duration:** As needed for revisions

#### Review Options:
- **Approve:** Say "approved", "looks good", "perfect", "yes", or similar
- **Revise:** Request specific changes like "make it shorter", "use more industry terms"
- **Cross-workflow:** Request different content types like social posts or press releases

#### Revision Examples:
- "Make the headline more industry-specific"
- "Add more technical details in the body"
- "Change the tone to be more casual"
- "Include more company information"
- "Make it shorter for a quicker read"

**Q: What if I don't like the generated headline?**
A: Simply request a revision: "Make the headline more specific to our industry" or "Create a more engaging headline."

**Q: How do I ensure the content matches our brand voice?**
A: Provide brand voice preferences during information collection, or request tone adjustments during review.

**Q: Can I get multiple content types from one blog workflow?**
A: Yes! During review, request additional asset types like "Also create a social post from this" or "Turn this into a press release."

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Generated content is too generic**
**Solution:** Provide more specific details about your topic, include unique angles or data points, request revision with "make it more specific to [your industry/situation]"

**Issue: Tone doesn't match brand voice**
**Solution:** Specify brand voice during information collection or request tone adjustment: "make it more [casual/formal/technical/conversational]"

**Issue: Content is too long/short**
**Solution:** Request length adjustment during review: "make it shorter for a 3-minute read" or "expand with more examples"

**Issue: Missing important information**
**Solution:** Request specific additions during review: "add more about [specific topic]" or "include information about [specific feature/benefit]"

**Issue: Want different content format**
**Solution:** Request cross-workflow transition: "turn this into a press release" or "create social posts from this content"
