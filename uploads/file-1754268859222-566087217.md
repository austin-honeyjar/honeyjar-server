# ðŸ“° Press Release Workflow Complete Guide

## Overview
The Press Release workflow creates professional, media-ready announcements in three streamlined steps. Designed for official company announcements following AP style guidelines and press release best practices.

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Information Collection  
**Goal:** Efficiently gather essential press release information
**Duration:** 2-5 minutes with intelligent auto-filling

#### Required Information:
- **Company name and description** - Who you are and what you do
- **Announcement details** - What you're announcing (product launch, partnership, funding, etc.)
- **Key news elements** - The core newsworthy information

#### Auto-Filled Defaults (smart defaults applied):
- Release date: "immediate release" or current date
- Pricing/availability: "pricing available upon request"
- Contact information: "media contact information available upon request"
- Executive quotes: AI-generated realistic leadership quotes
- Executive details: Generic "CEO" or "spokesperson" if not specified

#### Context Awareness Features:
- Extracts company details from conversation history
- Uses previous announcement information automatically
- Pre-fills fields with reasonable defaults to minimize questions
- Auto-completes based on detected announcement type

#### Completion Criteria:
- Proceeds when 60%+ of information is collected
- Essential: Company name + announcement topic
- Responds to "generate" or "proceed" commands immediately
- Maximum 3 follow-up questions for missing critical details

### Step 2: Asset Generation
**Goal:** Create professional, AP-style press release
**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

#### Press Release Structure Generated:
1. **Headline** (10-12 words max, no launch dates)
2. **Subhead** (1-2 sentences adding clarity and context)
3. **Dateline** (City, State â€” Date)
4. **Lead Paragraph** (Who, what, when, where, why in first 25 words)
5. **Challenge Paragraph** (Industry problems the announcement addresses)
6. **Solution Paragraph** (How announcement disrupts and solves challenges)
7. **Executive Quote #1** (Strategic importance and market impact)
8. **Supporting Details** (Features, benefits, supporting data)
9. **Executive Quote #2** (Partner, customer, or additional executive perspective)
10. **Financial/Impact Information** (Market impact, business transformation)
11. **Company Boilerplate** (Standard company description)
12. **Availability Information** (Distribution and availability details)
13. **Media Contact** (Name, email, phone)

#### Writing Standards Applied:
- **AP Style formatting** throughout
- **Third-person perspective** only
- **Professional, factual tone** without hyperbole
- **Active voice, present tense** for quotes
- **Past tense** for completed events
- **300-500 words total length**
- **Short paragraphs** (2-4 sentences each)

#### Narrative Structure:
1. **Lead with product/service launch** as strongest narrative
2. **Identify industry challenges** (inefficiencies, costs, accessibility)
3. **Show how announcement addresses challenges** directly
4. **Support with data and quotes** reinforcing the narrative

### Step 3: Asset Review
**Goal:** Review and refine the press release
**Duration:** As needed for revisions

#### Review Options:
- **Approve:** "approved", "looks good", "perfect", "yes", "ok", "good", "great", "fine"
- **Revise:** Request specific changes to content, tone, or structure
- **Cross-workflow:** Request different asset types (social posts, blog articles, media pitches)

#### Common Revision Requests:
- "Make the headline more specific to our industry"

## Common Questions and Answers

**Q: What's the difference between a press release and a media pitch?**
A: Press releases are official announcements distributed broadly to media. Media pitches are personalized outreach emails to specific journalists.

**Q: Should I include pricing in my press release?**
A: Only if it's a key part of the announcement. Otherwise, "pricing available upon request" is the standard approach.

**Q: Can I mention specific customers or partners?**
A: Yes, but ensure you have permission to mention them by name. Otherwise, use general descriptions.

**Q: How do I make my announcement newsworthy?**
A: Focus on industry impact, solving real problems, significant milestones, or unique technological advances.

**Q: What if my announcement isn't a product launch?**
A: The workflow adapts to any announcement type - funding, partnerships, hiring, company news, etc.

**Q: Should I include quotes from customers?**
A: Customer quotes can be powerful if you have permission. Otherwise, executive quotes focusing on customer impact work well.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Press release feels too promotional**
**Solution:** Request revision focused on news value: "make it more newsworthy and less promotional" or "focus more on industry impact"

**Issue: Missing important technical details**
**Solution:** Request specific additions: "add more technical specifications" or "include more details about [specific feature/capability]"

**Issue: Quotes sound artificial**
**Solution:** Request more natural quotes: "make the quotes sound more conversational" or "create quotes that sound like real executives"

**Issue: Headline doesn't capture main news**
**Solution:** Request headline revision: "make the headline focus more on [specific aspect]" or "create a more compelling headline"

**Issue: Need different distribution focus**
**Solution:** Request audience adjustment: "make it more appropriate for [specific audience]" or "adjust tone for [industry/geographic] media"

**Issue: Want to create related content**
**Solution:** Request cross-workflow assets: "create a media pitch from this" or "turn this into social media posts"
