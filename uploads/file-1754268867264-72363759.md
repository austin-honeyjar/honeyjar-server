# ðŸ“§ Media Pitch Workflow Complete Guide

## Overview
The Media Pitch workflow creates compelling, personalized media outreach emails in three streamlined steps. Designed for building relationships with journalists and securing media coverage through targeted, professional pitches.

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Information Collection
**Goal:** Efficiently gather essential information for media pitch creation
**Duration:** 2-5 minutes with intelligent auto-filling

#### Required Information:
- **Company name and description** - Your brand identity and what you do
- **News/announcement summary** - What you're pitching today
- **Pitch strategy** - Exclusive offer OR general pitch to multiple outlets
- **Newsworthiness angle** - Why this matters now and to their audience

#### Auto-Filled Defaults (smart defaults applied):
- Target media outlets: "relevant industry publications"
- Spokesperson details: "company spokesperson" or "CEO"
- Supporting data: "additional data available upon request"
- Available resources: "interviews and additional information available"
- Timeline: "immediate release"
- Contact information: "media contact information available upon request"

#### Context Awareness Features:
- Extracts company details from conversation history
- Uses previous announcement information automatically
- Pre-fills fields with reasonable defaults to minimize questions
- Auto-completes based on detected announcement type
- Leverages previous workflow contexts efficiently

#### Completion Criteria:
- Proceeds when 60%+ of information is collected
- Essential: Company name + announcement topic + pitch strategy
- Responds to "generate", "proceed", or "go ahead" immediately
- Maximum 3 follow-up questions for critical missing details
- **Critical early question:** Exclusive vs. general pitch strategy

### Step 2: Asset Generation
**Goal:** Create compelling, personalized media pitch
**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

#### Media Pitch Structure Generated:
1. **Subject Line** (50-60 characters, compelling and newsworthy)
2. **Personal Greeting** (professional and direct)
3. **Value Proposition** (immediate relevance to their audience)
4. **News Details** (clear, concise explanation of announcement)
5. **Newsworthiness** (why this matters now and to their readers)
6. **Supporting Elements** (data, unique angles, quotes)
7. **Available Resources** (interviews, additional information)
8. **Strategy-Specific Call to Action** (exclusive vs. general approach)

#### Writing Standards Applied:
- **Personalized, professional tone** without being overly promotional
- **Concise format** (200-300 words total)
- **Journalist-focused language** emphasizing story potential
- **Industry disruption themes** and workflow streamlining focus
- **Measured excitement** avoiding hyperbolic claims
- **Clear next steps** making it easy to respond

#### Strategy-Specific Adaptations:

**For Exclusive Pitches:**
- More personalized, urgent language
- Exclusive-specific call-to-action phrases
- "I'm coming to you first with the details"
- Deadline-oriented language for response

**For General Pitches:**
- Broader, inclusive language  
- General-interest call-to-action
- "Wanted to keep you in the loop"
- Non-pressure response language

### Step 3: Asset Review
**Goal:** Review and refine the media pitch
**Duration:** As needed for revisions

#### Review Options:
- **Approve:** "approved", "looks good", "perfect", "yes", or similar positive feedback
- **Revise:** Request specific changes to tone, personalization, or strategy
- **Cross-workflow:** Request different content types (press releases, blog articles, social posts)

#### Common Revision Requests:
- "Make it more personalized for tech journalists"
- "Add more industry-specific data"
- "Change the subject line to be more compelling"
- "Adjust for exclusive vs. general pitch strategy"
- "Include more technical details"
- "Make the call-to-action stronger"

## Common Questions and Answers

**Q: What's the difference between a media pitch and a press release?**
A: Media pitches are personalized outreach emails to specific journalists. Press releases are official announcements distributed broadly to media.

**Q: Should I send exclusive pitches to multiple journalists?**
A: No - exclusive means one journalist/outlet only. For multiple outlets, use the general pitch strategy.

**Q: How do I make my pitch more newsworthy?**
A: Focus on industry impact, solving real problems, unique innovation, market disruption, or significant company milestones.

**Q: When should I follow up on a pitch?**
A: Wait 3-5 business days before following up. For exclusive pitches with deadlines, follow up closer to the deadline.

**Q: Can I pitch the same story to different journalists?**
A: Yes, but personalize each pitch for the specific journalist and publication. Use general pitch strategy for multiple outlets.

**Q: What if a journalist doesn't respond?**
A: No response is common. Move on to other opportunities unless you have a specific relationship or urgent deadline.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Pitch feels too promotional or sales-y**
**Solution:** Request revision focused on news value: "make it more newsworthy and less promotional" or "focus on industry impact rather than company benefits"

**Issue: Subject line not compelling enough**
**Solution:** Request subject line improvement: "create a more compelling subject line" or "make the subject line more specific to [industry/topic]"

**Issue: Need different personalization approach**
**Solution:** Request targeting adjustment: "make it more appropriate for tech journalists" or "adjust for [specific publication type]"

**Issue: Call-to-action too weak or too pushy**
**Solution:** Request CTA adjustment: "make the call-to-action stronger" or "make it less pushy and more informational"

**Issue: Missing important context or data**
**Solution:** Request specific additions: "include more technical details" or "add market data to support the newsworthiness"

**Issue: Need to create supporting content**
**Solution:** Request cross-workflow assets: "create a press release from this pitch" or "generate social media posts for when coverage runs"
