GOAL:
Collect the topic or subject matter for which the user wants to analyze media coverage and author relevance.

TASK:
1. Accept specific topics for media matching analysis
2. Store the topic for use in AI author generation and article searches
3. Only mark as complete when you have actionable topic input

EXAMPLES OF ACCEPTABLE INPUTS:
- Specific: "artificial intelligence in healthcare", "renewable energy policy", "cryptocurrency regulation"
- Industry: "fintech", "biotech", "climate tech"
- General: "AI", "healthcare", "technology", "climate change"

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this structure:

If the user provides a valid topic:
{
  "isComplete": true,
  "collectedInformation": {
    "topic": "user's topic exactly as provided",

  },
  "nextQuestion": "Perfect! I'll use AI to identify authors who typically write about '[topic]', then search for their recent articles. Moving to AI author generation...",

Only if the user's input is unclear or too vague:

  "isComplete": false,

    "lastInput": "user's input"

  "nextQuestion": "I need a specific topic to analyze media coverage effectively. Please provide a topic like 'artificial intelligence', 'climate policy', 'fintech regulation', or any subject you want to analyze for media coverage and author expertise."

        baseInstructions: `Generate 20 potential journalists and 10 keywords for this topic. These will be filtered down to the top 10 based on actual article relevance.

TWO-PHASE APPROACH:
- **PHASE 1**: Generate 20 potential authors who might write about this topic
- **PHASE 2**: Algorithmic filtering will reduce to top 10 with actual relevant recent articles
- **GOAL**: Cast a wider net to ensure we find authors with real recent coverage

üéØ **CRITICAL: RECENT PUBLICATION FOCUS**
Your PRIMARY job is suggesting authors who have RECENTLY written about this SPECIFIC topic area (not just general industry). Think:
- Who covered similar fundraising announcements in the past 6 months?
- Which reporters specifically write about autonomous delivery/robotics (not just "tech")?
- Who follows this exact company type, technology, or market segment?
- What journalists have bylines on stories about related companies, funding rounds, or innovations?

REQUIREMENTS:
- 20 real journalist names (no placeholders like "John Doe")
- Industry/trade publications prioritized for niche topics  
- One author per publication (no duplicates)
- Score recent topic relevance 1-10 for each author based on likelihood they've written about THIS specific topic recently
- 2-3 sentence reasoning explaining why contact each author AND what specific recent articles they likely wrote
- 10 relevant keywords

üîç **ENHANCED AUTHOR SELECTION STRATEGY**:
**STEP 1: Topic-Specific Beat Reporters**
- Start with journalists who specifically cover the exact topic area (e.g., autonomous delivery, not just "transportation")
- Look for reporters who regularly write about funding rounds in this specific industry
- Include beat reporters from trade publications who focus on this niche

**STEP 2: Company/Competitor Coverage**
- Find authors who've written about similar companies, competitors, or industry players
- Include journalists who covered related funding announcements or product launches
- Look for reporters who follow specific investors, accelerators, or VCs in this space

**STEP 3: Strategic Adjacent Coverage**
- Include emerging voices and specialized beat reporters with relevant recent coverage
- Consider authors who cover adjacent topics that frequently intersect (e.g., AI + logistics, robotics + urban planning)
- Focus on authors likely to have written SOMETHING directly related in past 3-6 months

**STEP 4: Publication Strategy**
- Mix obvious tier-1 choices with niche specialists who have recent relevant coverage
- Include less obvious but highly relevant specialists from trade publications
- Prioritize active coverage over publication size for niche topics

üéØ **PUBLICATION PRIORITIZATION**:
**For Tech/Business Topics**: 
- **First Priority**: Authors with recent coverage of similar companies, funding, or technology
- **Trade Publications**: TechCrunch (funding), The Information (inside tech), Forbes (business), Axios (tech policy)
- **Industry Specialist**: VentureBeat (funding), IEEE Spectrum (robotics), Supply Chain Dive (logistics)
- **Major Outlets**: Only if they have reporters who specifically cover this beat

**For Niche Topics**: 
- **Prioritize trade/industry publications** with recent relevant coverage over general news
- **Focus**: Authors actively covering this topic area with recent relevant content
- **Include**: Specialized publications that readers in this industry actually follow

üö® **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Use REAL journalist names like "Kirsten Korosec" (TechCrunch autonomous vehicles), "Alex Davies" (Wired transportation tech), "Will Knight" (Wired AI)
- NO placeholder names like "John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Author Name"
- Always return "isComplete": true to auto-proceed
- Include actual author names in nextQuestion response
- For "reasoning" field: Specifically mention what recent articles they likely wrote about this topic
