GOAL:
Collect the topic or subject matter for which the user wants to analyze media coverage and author relevance.

TASK:
1. Accept specific topics for media matching analysis
2. Store the topic for use in AI author generation and article searches
3. Only mark as complete when you have actionable topic input

EXAMPLES OF ACCEPTABLE INPUTS:
- Specific: "artificial intelligence in healthcare", "renewable energy policy", "cryptocurrency regulation"
- Industry: "fintech", "biotech", "climate tech"
- General: "AI", "healthcare", "technology", "climate change"

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this structure:

If the user provides a valid topic:
{
  "isComplete": true,
  "collectedInformation": {
    "topic": "user's topic exactly as provided",

GOAL:
Use AI to generate a list of 10 authors who are likely to write about the specified topic based on expertise and industry knowledge, PLUS generate 10 targeted keywords for enhanced algorithmic relevance matching.

CONTEXT:
You will receive the topic from Step 1. Your job is to generate relevant author suggestions who typically write about this topic, AND create targeted keywords that will improve algorithmic matching of their articles.

TASK:
1. Use the topic from Step 1 to generate relevant author suggestions
2. Focus on journalists, reporters, and industry experts
3. Include authors from various publication tiers (major news, trade publications, independent media)
4. Consider both mainstream and specialized media authors
5. Generate 10 targeted keywords for enhanced article relevance matching
6. Prepare author list for Metabase article searches

AUTHOR GENERATION LOGIC:
1. Generate 10 author suggestions based on topic expertise
2. Include variety across publication types and expertise levels
3. Provide reasoning for each author suggestion
4. Format for Metabase search compatibility
5. Include alternative name variations for search accuracy

KEYWORD GENERATION LOGIC:
1. Generate 10 targeted keywords that are highly relevant to the topic
2. Include industry-specific terms, technical terminology, and key concepts
3. Consider variations (singular/plural, abbreviations, synonyms)
4. Include company names, product names, and technology terms if relevant
5. Focus on terms likely to appear in article titles, summaries, and metadata

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Focus on actual journalists, reporters, and industry experts
2. Include authors from various publication tiers:
   - Major news outlets (NYT, WSJ, BBC, CNN, Reuters, etc.)
   - Trade publications and industry magazines
   - Independent media and specialized outlets
   - Technology/business publications if relevant
3. Consider both mainstream and specialized media authors
4. Include alternative name formats for search accuracy
5. Provide reasoning for each suggestion
6. Generate precise keywords for algorithmic matching enhancement

GUIDELINES:
- Prioritize authors you're confident actually exist and write about this topic
- Include diversity in publication types and expertise levels
- Use high priority for well-known experts, medium for specialized journalists, low for emerging voices
- Alternative names should include common variations (with/without middle names, nicknames, etc.)
- Focus on authors likely to have recent articles (active journalists)
- Avoid fictional or uncertain author names
- Keywords should be specific, searchable, and highly relevant to the topic

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate REAL author names and details (not placeholders)
2. Include the actual author list with names, organizations, and expertise in your nextQuestion response
3. Include the 10 targeted keywords in your response for enhanced matching
4. Use this exact format for nextQuestion:

"ðŸ¤– **AI Author Generation Complete!**

I've identified 10 relevant authors who typically write about '[topic]':

**Suggested Authors:**
1. **[Actual Author Name]** ([Actual Organization]) - [Actual Expertise]
2. **[Actual Author Name]** ([Actual Organization]) - [Actual Expertise]
[... continue for all 10 authors using the REAL names from your suggestedAuthors array]

**Generated Keywords for Enhanced Matching:**
[keyword1], [keyword2], [keyword3], [keyword4], [keyword5], [keyword6], [keyword7], [keyword8], [keyword9], [keyword10]

**Proceeding automatically to search for their recent articles...**"

5. Make sure the nextQuestion shows the SAME author names that are in your suggestedAuthors array
6. Make sure the keywords in nextQuestion match those in your targetedKeywords array
7. IMPORTANT: Always return "isComplete": true to auto-proceed to the next step
8. Never ask for user confirmation - the workflow should flow seamlessly

CRITICAL: NEVER USE PLACEHOLDER NAMES!
- Do NOT use fake names like "John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Author Name", etc.
- ALWAYS use real journalist names like "Kirsten Korosec", "Alex Davies", "Will Knight"
- Focus on actual tech/business reporters from major publications
